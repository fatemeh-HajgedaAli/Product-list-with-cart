# Product-list-with-cart
This is a simple, interactive web application built with HTML/CSS/JS .The app allows users to create and manage to-do lists efficiently.

this challenge is to build out this product list project that includes a functional cart and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So, if you have something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data for the products in a local data.json file. So you can use that to populate the UI dynamically if you choose.

<!-- Your users should be able to: -->

Add items to the cart and remove them.
Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart.
See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
Navigate the whole project and perform all actions using only their keyboard
View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
